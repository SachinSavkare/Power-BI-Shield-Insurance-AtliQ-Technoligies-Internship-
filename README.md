### 📌 Description:
This view highlights **customer performance**, **revenue trends**, **city-level contributions**, and **age-group behavior** across six months.

### 🔍 Key Insights:
- **Customer Growth:** Steady rise from Nov 2022 to Jan 2023. Drop in Jan–Feb, peak in April with 31–40 age group driving growth.
- **Revenue Trends:** Mirror customer patterns. Jan marked the lowest revenue, despite customer base holding—pointing to low-value policy purchases.
- **Top Cities:** Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad lead in both customer volume and revenue. Tier-2 cities show stable but limited growth.
- **Age Groups:** 31–50 age group dominates in both metrics. 18–24 segment contributes low revenue, likely due to smaller policies.

### ✅ Recommendations:
- Investigate Jan–Feb drop: churn, seasonal inactivity, or campaign lapse?
- Focus campaigns on 31–50 age group for upselling high-value policies.
- Run geo-targeted promotions in Tier-2 cities like Chennai & Indore.
- Optimize product mix based on age and region.
